    <h2>A project to unleash the inner ü§ì by Martin Gaston.</h2>
    <p>I've sort of got to confess that my knowledge of the multiplication tables aren't ideal - which isn't something that
      I'm proud of whenever it comes to splitting a bill or managing a budget. So I wanted to make something I could use
      to refine those skills quickly and easily.</p>
