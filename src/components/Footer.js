        Confession: my knowledge of the multiplication tables isn&apos;t ideal -
        which isn&apos;t something I&apos;m proud of whenever it comes to
        splitting a bill or managing a budget. So I wanted to make something I
        could use to refine those skills quickly and easily, and without having
        to be lectured to by a talking animal character like in most other
        multiplication apps.
